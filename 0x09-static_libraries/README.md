##C - Static libraries

ALX School Project on C language - learning about static library, how it works, how to create and use it. Also, the basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm.

##Technologies

The files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

##Files and Description

`libmy.a` A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.

Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:

If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your main.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

`create_static_lib.sh` Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
